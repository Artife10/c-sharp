So you're the one running about tripping my alarms. Care to explain yourself?

The Lord Regent sent me to retrieve the Forge.

That thing is finally making its move. hm? I'd thought it would come personally, but the Lord Regent must see me as a mere agent's workload.

That 'thing'? Agent?

There's no real point in explaining further, as this is the end of the line. Even if you gave up on the Forge, I'm not about to let one who's seen this manor's layout roam free.

Etrea has really stooped to hiring the blades of its enemies? That island's prospects are certainly grim...
